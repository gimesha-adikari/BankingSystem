# Architecture Document for Multi-Platform Banking System

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architecture of the Multi-Platform Banking System, designed to provide banking services
across Web, Android, and Desktop platforms with core functionalities and AI enhancements.

---

## 2. System Overview

The system supports user account management, transactions, loans, notifications, and AI-powered features such as fraud
detection and credit scoring.

---

## 3. Architecture Style

The architecture is modular and layered, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns:

- **Presentation Layer:** Web frontend (React.js), Android app (Kotlin), Desktop app (JavaFX)
- **Backend Layer:** RESTful APIs using Spring Boot (Java)
- **Database Layer:** Relational database (MySQL)
- **AI/ML Services:** Python microservices for fraud detection, credit scoring, and chatbot (FastAPI)
- **Notification Services:** Integration with email (SMTP) and SMS providers (e.g., Twilio)

## 4. Key Components

| Component        | Description                                          | Technology Stack              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Web Frontend     | User interface for browser access                    | React.js                      |
| Android App      | Mobile banking app                                   | Kotlin                        |
| Desktop App      | Desktop client for banking services                  | JavaFX                        |
| Backend API      | Business logic and data handling                     | Spring Boot (Java)            |
| Database         | Persistent storage for user and transaction data     | MySQL                         |
| Authentication   | Secure login and authorization                       | JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth2 |
| AI Microservices | Fraud detection, credit scoring, chatbot             | Python (FastAPI)              |
| Notifications    | Email and SMS alerts                                 | SMTP, Twilio                  |

## 5. Data Flow

1. User interacts with frontend (Web, Android, Desktop)
2. Frontend sends API requests to backend (Spring Boot)
3. Backend processes requests, accesses the database or calls AI microservices
4. AI microservices return analysis or scores as needed
5. Backend sends response back to frontend
6. Notification system triggers alerts or messages

---

## 6. Security Considerations

- Stateless authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control (Customer, Teller, Manager, Admin)
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest (database) and in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- Compliance with PCI-DSS for payment security and GDPR for data privacy

---

## 7. Deployment Overview

- Backend and AI services deployed on a cloud provider (AWS / Azure / GCP)
- MySQL database hosted on managed cloud database service
- Web frontend served via CDN or hosting services (Netlify, Vercel)
- Mobile app deployed on Google Play Store
- Desktop app distributed via installer or app store

---

## 8. Future Enhancements

- Implement two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Expand AI services for predictive analytics
- Support for additional platforms (iOS, tablet)
- Scalability improvements using container orchestration (Kubernetes)

---

## 9. Diagrams (To be added)

- System Context Diagram showing user roles and external systems
- Component Diagram illustrating interactions between frontend, backend, database, and AI microservices
- ER Diagram representing database schema and relationships
