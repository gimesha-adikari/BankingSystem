## Security & Compliance Needs

To safeguard the multi-platform banking system, protect user data, and meet regulatory requirements, the following security and compliance measures are implemented.

---

### 1. Authentication Methods

- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**
    - Used for stateless user authentication across Web, Android, and Desktop clients.
    - Tokens include user identity and role claims, digitally signed to prevent tampering.
    - Access tokens have limited lifetime; refresh tokens allow session renewal without re-login.
    - JWT enables efficient role-based access control throughout the system.

- **OAuth2 Authorization Framework**
    - Supports delegated access, allowing integration with third-party services securely.
    - Facilitates secure authorization flows such as authorization code grant and client credentials.
    - OAuth2 scopes limit the extent of access granted to external applications.

### 2. Data Encryption

- **Encryption at Rest**
    - Sensitive data stored in databases (e.g., user passwords, personal info, transaction records) is encrypted using industry-standard algorithms like AES-256.
    - Database backups and snapshots are also encrypted and stored securely.
    - Encryption keys are managed securely with restricted access and rotation policies.

- **Encryption in Transit**
    - All data transmitted between clients and servers uses HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher to ensure confidentiality and integrity.
    - Secure WebSocket connections (WSS) are used where real-time communication is needed.
    - Certificates are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) and renewed regularly.

### 3. Compliance Standards

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
    - Personal data collection is minimized and used only for legitimate purposes.
    - Users can access, modify, or request deletion of their data in compliance with GDPR rights.
    - Consent is obtained explicitly for data processing activities.
    - Data breaches are logged and reported as required by law.

- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**
    - Cardholder data is encrypted and never stored in plaintext.
    - Secure network architecture prevents unauthorized access.
    - Access to cardholder data is restricted to authorized personnel only.
    - Regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests are conducted to identify and remediate security weaknesses.
    - Incident response plans are defined for handling security events.

---

### 4. Additional Security Measures

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    - Access permissions are granted based on user roles (Customer, Teller, Manager, Admin).
    - Least privilege principle is enforced to minimize risk.

- **Logging and Audit Trails**
    - All critical operations (logins, transactions, data changes) are logged with timestamps and user identifiers.
    - Logs are monitored for suspicious activities.

- **Secure Password Policies**
    - Enforce strong passwords with minimum length and complexity requirements.
    - Passwords are stored hashed using secure algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.

- **Regular Security Reviews and Updates**
    - Security patches and updates are applied promptly to all components.
    - Continuous monitoring and improvement of security posture.

### Summary

Implementing robust authentication, encryption, and compliance ensures that the multi-platform banking system protects user data, maintains trust, and operates within legal frameworks. These security principles form the backbone of a reliable and secure financial application.
