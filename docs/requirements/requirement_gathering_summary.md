## Requirement Gathering Note

As this is a solo and demo-focused project, traditional requirement workshops and stakeholder interviews were not conducted.  
Instead, I took a practical approach by researching real-world banking systems and common industry practices to identify core functionalities and workflows.

The requirements were shaped through independent analysis of typical user roles (e.g., Customers, Tellers, Managers) and services (such as account management, transactions, and loan processing), ensuring that the project stays aligned with standard expectations in the banking domain.

This approach allowed me to focus on rapid development while maintaining relevance to realistic banking system behavior.
